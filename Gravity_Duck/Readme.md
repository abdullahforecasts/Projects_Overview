## 📖 Project Motivation

**Gravity Duck** was developed not just as a game, but as an **awareness platform**. The objective is to reflect the cruelty ducks face in real life — including:

* **Mass-killing of male ducklings**, discarded as “useless”
* **Live-plucking of ducks** in the down feather industry

Each obstacle in the game personifies a real-world contributor to duck brutality — turning gameplay into a symbolic rescue mission.

> The goal: **awareness, empathy, and a call to question comfort built on cruelty**.
